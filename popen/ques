Write a C/C++ program that uses the UNIX pipe and process control system calls (fork,
exec, exit, pipe, wait and dup2) to connect a series of processes in a "pipeline", such that
the standard output of the first process is connected to the standard input of the second
process, the standard output of the second is connected to the standard input of the third,
and so on.
If your executable program for the above is upp.exe then the command line
$upp P1 P2 P3 P4
should be executed as the standard output of P1 should go as standard input of P2 and the
standard output of P2 should go as standard output of P3, and so on.
You can write any simple logic programs for P1, P2, P3, P4.
